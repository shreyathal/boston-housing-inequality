Boston Housing Inequality Analysis

Time Spent: 2 hours, completed on the Northeast Regional Amtrack from Bos to NYC :) 

An interactive data storytelling website visualizing historical and present-day housing inequalities in Boston, Massachusetts. This project combines narrative writing with data visualization to explore how redlining, evictions, racial displacement, and gentrification have shaped Boston neighborhoods.

This site presents four core visualizations:

- **Evictions**: Eviction filing disparities by neighborhood
- **Redlining**: Historic HOLC risk grading from the 1930s
- **Demographic Change**: Racial composition shifts in Roxbury from 1980–2020
- **Gentrification**: Rent increases from 2010–2020 across key neighborhoods

Each chart is paired with contextual analysis, live source links, and accessible design. The page loads with the first chart pre-selected, and users can toggle between visualizations using clearly marked buttons.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- **Chart.js** for interactive visualizations
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment
